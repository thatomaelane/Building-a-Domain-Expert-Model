# Fine-Tuning a Domain Expert Language Model with Meta Llama 2 7B

## Project Overview

This project aims to fine-tune the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model to create a domain expert language model. The resulting model will be capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant responses within a specific domain (Finance, Medical, or IT). This is an essential step in building intelligent chat applications, internal knowledge systems, or automated content generation tools for businesses.

## Project Objectives

Deploy the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model on AWS Sagemaker.

Fine-tune the model using a domain-specific, copyright-free dataset.

Test and evaluate the fine-tuned model for domain-specific text generation.

Document the process and present the findings.

## Prerequisites

AWS account with Sagemaker access.

Basic knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing.

Familiarity with Python and Sagemaker SDK.

## Project Steps

1. ### Configure AWS Sagemaker Resources

 . Set up S3 buckets for data storage.

 . Configure IAM roles for Sagemaker permissions.

 . Launch a Sagemaker notebook instance or Studio environment.

2. ### Deploy the Meta Llama 2 7B Foundation Model

 . Use the Sagemaker API to deploy the model.

 . Test the base model for general text generation.

3. ### Fine-Tune the Model

 . Choose a domain-specific dataset (Finance, Medical, or IT).

 . Prepare the dataset for training.

 . Fine-tune the model using the Sagemaker API.

4. ### Evaluate the Model

 . Test the fine-tuned model for accuracy and domain relevance.

 . Compare responses with the base model to assess improvement.

5. ### Deploy and Test the Fine-Tuned Model

 . Deploy the fine-tuned model.

 . Validate its performance on real-world domain-specific queries.

6. ### Document and Submit

 . Prepare project documentation.

 . Submit the final project for review.

## Expected Deliverables

Fine-tuned domain expert model.

Evaluation report on model performance.

Presentation slides detailing the project process and findings.
